* `options` (Object; optional): The options for initializing the player.
	* The options are completely arbitrary, to be used as a key/value store for any data you may want to track about the player.

```js
var player = new Player({
	name: "Scott"
});
```

### Player#addPoint()

Adds a point to the player's score.

```js
player.addPoint();
```

### Player#addPoints(points)

Adds points to the player's score.

* `points` (Number): The number of points to add.

```js
player.addPoints(25);
```

### Player#removePoint()

Removes a point from the player's score.

```js
player.removePoint();
```

### Player#removePoints(points)

Removes points from the player's score.

* `points` (Number): The number of points to remove.

```js

```

### Player#getScore()

Gets the player's score.

```js
var score = player.getScore();
```

### Player#getOption()
